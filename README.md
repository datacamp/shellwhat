`shellwhat` enables you to write Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) for interactive Shell exercises on DataCamp.

- If you are new to teaching on DataCamp, check out https://instructor-support.datacamp.com.
- If you want to learn what SCTs are and how they work, visit [this article](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/courses/course-development/submission-correctness-tests) specifically.
- For a complete overview of all functionality inside `shellwhat` and articles about what to use when, consult https://shellwhat.readthedocs.io.

Installing
----------

```bash
pip install shellwhat
```

Development
-----------

Install everything needed for developing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

By default, the `DummyParser` is used, that does not parse the shell code.
Hence, you can not run tests that need this parser:

```bash
pytest -m "not osh"
```

If you also want to run these 'parser tests',
there is a Dockerfile to parse shell commands with
the [Oil parser](https://github.com/oilshell/oil):

```bash
# Look in Makefile for details
SHELLWHAT_PARSER='docker' make test
```
